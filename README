You should use Paket's github dependency to include the YoLo.fs file into your
project.

  https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/github-dependencies.html

Because it's licensed under the wtf-you-want license you can use this code in
any way you want.

Run this when you want to adapt YoLo to your project:

  ruby -pi.bak -e "gsub(/module internal YoLo/, 'module internal YOURNAMESPACE.YoLo')" paket-files/haf/YoLo/YoLo.fs
